#  Building the Perfect effective Team

+ From my college experience, I am fully aware of the concept that  " a successful team is not a condition of its members being highly intelligent"<br>

+ from story of Julia Rozovsky, I imagined myself in her place,
  perhaps because I was exposed to the same position in joining the teams, I do not know,
  but I understand very well to be part of a team where everyone thinks that he 
  is the one who makes the right decision and that his idea is the best. <br>

  You can say that in order to build a successful team, the following must be available 
  as I understood from the article and as I know from my experience: <br>

+ Members who possess leadership personality should make up approximately 10% of the team.<br>
+ Members of high intellectual mental capacity should be approximately 10% as well, if any.<br>

+ Members with a charismatic personality and to gain more experience at least 40% of the team.<br>

+ The team must agree on the achievement that must be achieved in order for the team to succeed,
  and this point is essential because most of the members may consider themselves successful if they only participate in a team,
  but from the perspective of a high-energy person if he does not achieve an achievement corresponding to his fatigue,
  he will not accept this success. <br>

+ There must also be a friendly relationship between them outside the framework of work, 
  as external activities enhance the relationship between them, which leads to communication between them clearly to achieve the desired goal.<br>

> The topic is rather big and depends on the humor of the team and their unity on the idea.
  But I hope to find a team who can work as comfortably as Julia did

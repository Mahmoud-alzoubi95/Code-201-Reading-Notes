## HTML

# Images

1. To add an image into the page you need to use an *img tag
2. Src This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your own site
3. Alt This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.
4. Title You can also use the title attribute additional information about the image
5. height This specifies the height of the image in pixels
6. Width This specifies the width of the image in pixels.


img src=”images/quokka.jpg” alt=”A family of quokka” width=”600” height=”450”.

* Where an image is placed in the code will affect how it is displayed
* The align attribute was commonly used to indicate how the other parts of a page should flow around an image.
* You must always specify a src attribute to indicate the source of an image and an alt attribute to describe the content of an image.
* You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
* Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.


### colors

- very color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker.
- There are three ways to specify colors in CSS: RGB values, hex codes, and color names
- Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps convey the mood and evokes reactions.
- Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
- CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
- CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values, with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
- It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content).


### Text

* There are properties to control the choice of font, size, weight, style, and spacing
* There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume most people will have installed.
* If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.
* You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be indented.
* You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
